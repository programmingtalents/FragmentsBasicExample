# FragmentsBasicExample
Example to show how to add fragment and how  fragment can interacts with its parent(actvity).

In this example , I have not removed the auto-generated code , just for your comfort.
You can remove unnecessary code at any time.

You might get confused if i have done that.
Ex :
// TODO: Rename parameter arguments, choose names that match
    // the fragment initialization parameters, e.g. ARG_ITEM_NUMBER
    private static final String ARG_PARAM1 = "param1";
    private static final String ARG_PARAM2 = "param2";
    
    You can remove these parameters or change it as per the need.
